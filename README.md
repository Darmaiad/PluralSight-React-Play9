This project is based on the excellent [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course [React.js: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents) by [Samer Buna](https://github.com/samerbuna).

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and I used the React.js editions of [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started.html) and [Font-Awesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fontawesome). 

It includes an implementation of timer challenge issued by the course's author at the end of the project. I expanded on that bu having the game including a distinct start/stop phase. Finally, I used Alertify.js to display a couple of messages.
