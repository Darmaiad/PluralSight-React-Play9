# React.js: Getting Started (Pluralsight)

This project is based on the excellent [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course [React.js: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents) by [Samer Buna](https://github.com/samerbuna).

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and I used the React.js editions of [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started.html) and [Font-Awesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fontawesome). 

It includes an implementation of timer challenge issued by the course's author at the end of the course. I expanded on that by having the game to include a distinct start/stop phase. Finally, I used [Alertify.js](http://alertifyjs.com/) to display a couple of messages.

## Installation
Assuming you have npm & node.js installed, you can either clone or download the repository. Navigate to the folder that you/was created. Then, run `npm install` on the command line to download the dependencies. Finally, run `npm start` to launch to the project.
