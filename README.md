This project is based on the excellent [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course [React.js: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents).

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and I used the React.js editions of [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started.html) and [Font-Awesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fontawesome).

Right now I'm stuck implementing the timer challenge issued by the course's author at the end of the project. I'll also update the project to use some other React.js add-ons in order for me to get some practice with.
